# About

We are planning for a reboot of [http://ruby.sg/](http://ruby.sg/) and we need content!

Let's work on the content here - makes the job of the designer easier too.

## What is Ruby?

Ruby, according to the official site (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/) is:

> A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

## What is RubySG?

tl:dr We are a group of nice people who love Ruby and meeting new #rubyfriends!

RubySG (also known as the Singapore Ruby Brigade or the Singapore Ruby Group) is a user group in Singapore that celebrates the Ruby programming language.

The group's origins lie in a casual conversation between several people (Sau Sheong, Choon Keat etc) on 22 June 2006 at an e27 meetup. A Google Group (see [first post](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/singapore-rb/ZXMA0Pg8uW4)) was created shortly thereafter, offering a space for early Singapore Rubyists to gather and talk about Ruby.

The first official meetup was held on 5 July 2006 at Starbucks, Raffles City, with a total turn out of less than 10 people. Subsequent meetups were also sporadic, and finding a good meetup location was constantly a challenge. Early RubySG meetups revolved around "Rails", "Hosting and Deployment" (No Heroku then!), "TDD", "BDD" amongst other topics.

By 2014, RubySG has grown into a strong community with an average turnout of about 60 Rubyists at every monthly meetup. Many companies have also gladly stepped up to sponsor venue, food and drinks for our meetups!

## Ruby Meetups

### When: Last or second last Tuesday of every month

### What?

RubySG meets every month and we usually have 1-2 short talks followed by a "5 Random Ruby Tips" segment at every meetup. The venue for the meetup varies so that we can reach the most Rubyists. We have held meetups before at Block 71 in the heart of Singapore's start-up scene, as well as various company offices in town such as Neo, ThoughtWorks, PayPal etc. We welcome everyone from Ruby novices to experts to join us at our monthly meetup, meet fellow rubyists and share your knowledge. We are excited to grow and spread the love for Ruby!

## Rails Girls Meetups

### When: Last Saturday of every month

### What?
Did you know that the first international version of Rails Girls happened in Singapore? Linda Liukas, Founder of Rails Girls, flew all the way from Finland to Singapore in 2011 to help run the first ever Rails Girls in Singapore.

Inspired by this history, in June 2014, we restarted the Singapore chapter of Rails Girls. Since then, the Rails Girls meetup has been another monthly activity for the Ruby community in Singapore, at which we share our knowledge of Ruby on Rails with ladies who are interested in learning to code.
