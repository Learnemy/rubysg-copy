# About

We are planning for a reboot of [http://ruby.sg/](http://ruby.sg/) and we need content!

Let's work on the content here - makes the job of the designer easier too.

## What is Ruby?

Ruby, according to the official site (https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/about/) is:

> A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.

## What is RubySG?

tl:dr We are a group of nice people who love Ruby, and meeting new #rubyfriends!

RubySG, also known as Singapore Ruby Brigade or Singapore Ruby Group, is a user group in Singapore that celebrates the use of the Ruby programming language.

The group's origin started from a causal conversation between several people (Sau Sheong, Choon Keat etc) on 22 June 2006 at a e27 meetup, and the Google Group (see [first post](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/singapore-rb/ZXMA0Pg8uW4)) was created shortly thereafter where early Singapore Rubyists gathered to chit chat about Ruby.

The first official meetup was held on 5 July 2006 at Starbucks, Raffles City with a total turn out of less than 10 people. The subsequently meetups were also sporadic, and finding a good meetup location was constantly a challenge. Meetups during those times revolved around "Rails", Hosting and Deployment" (No Heroku then!), "TDD", "BDD" amongst others.

Since then, RubySG has grown from strength to strength with an average turnout of about 60 Rubyists (2014) at every monthly meetup, and many companies have also gladly stepped up to sponsor venue, food and drinks for our meetups!

## Ruby Meetups

### When: Last or second last Tuesday of every month

### What?

RubySG meets regularly every month and we usually have 1-2 short talks followed by a "5 Random Ruby Tips" segment on every meetup. The venue for the meetup varies and we have done it before at Blk 71 or companies in town such as Neo, ThoughtWorks, PayPal etc. We welcome everyone from Ruby novices to experts to join us at our monthly meetup, meet fellow rubyists and share your knowledge. We are excited to grow and spread the love for Ruby!

## Rails Girls Meetups

### When: Last Saturday of every month

### What?
Did you know that the first international version of Rails Girls actually happened in Singapore! Linda Liukas, Founder of Rails Girls flew all the way from Finland to Singapore in 2011 to help run the first ever Rails Girls in Singapore with great fanfare, but unfortunately, we were unable to sustain the momentum then.

In June 2014, we restarted the Singapore chapter of Rails Girls, and since then, Rails Girls meetup has been another monthly activity for the Ruby community in Singapore, during which we impart our knowledge of Ruby on Rails to ladies who are interesting in learning to code.
